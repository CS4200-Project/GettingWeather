Getting Weather and Temperature from Images

In this project we will discover the effectiveness of AI in extracting weather information from images. To accomplish this we will use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to help us analyze images and gather data from them. Our efforts will be focused on improving the accuracy of previous methods of extracting different weather features such as temperature and weather conditions from images. With this we hope to garner experience building AI systems and learn about image processing in a real world setting.
